We are so happy we found Cake because he does all of that and more. He is so gracious with the guests, very punctual with messaging, takes care of maintenance things, and was there to quickly take care of all the issues that came up. Cake has maintained our 100% 5-star ratings and our super-host status, and he has done it all for a steal compared to the competition. He has proven himself to be trustworthy and responsible and our revenue has even increased since he took over. We highly recommend Ha'le Rentals to everyone we know!</p>

Like so fast at getting someone there it was amazing. I totally recommend staying here in this cute and cozy home!</p>
